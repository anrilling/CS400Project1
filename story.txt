There once was a boy named Marco. He went to the market to buy some milk. But on his way to the market he crossed paths with a troll. The troll said there would be three obstacles on his path to the market and offered him the choice of a map or a bow and arrows or a horse. Marco laughed and said he did not need the troll's help. A little while down the road Marco came across a very tall hedge. Jut outside the opening a plaque read "The Labyrinth, enter at your own risk.‚Äù Marco laughed again. He was not afraid. Into the maze he went. Turning left then right then left again, eventually Marco became lost. His mind flashed back to the troll who had offered him the map. But Marco knew he could get passed the maze with out the map. He began to climb the hedge to get a better view. Once at the top of the hedge, he saw a clear path to the other side. He climbed down and made his way out, but his next obstacle was just outside the maze.
